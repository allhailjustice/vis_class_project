We have completed the following parts of our project:
* Create a synthetic dataset of binary symmetric matrices (each has 100 vertices and 100 edges). We uploaded 100 matrices to "matrices" folder (github has a constraint the number of files in a folder)
* Implement program to sample the frequence of graphlets, the algorithm is in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07504).
* Train a nearest neighbour model including 1000 instances (the trained model is "train_features.npy").
* Test our model by comparing the estimated layout and real layout.
