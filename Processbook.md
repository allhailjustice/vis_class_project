## Overview and Motivation
* Graph is often used to abstract data. In many research fields, the problem of data analysis can be transformed into graph analysis that focuses on the topological structure of graph. One of the important parts of this project is to measure the topological similarity between graphs, which is exact what we are interested in.
* This project combines visualization and machine learning. It works on predicting visualiztion performance on specific layouts for graph, using machine learning strategy. By doing this project, we may get further inspriation on how to apply machine learning approaches to visualization.
* So far, the ways we have learnt in class to evaluate visualization layouts are more like intuitive senses rather than numerical metrics. However, the latter one can lead to automatic evaluation process withou human inspection, which is very convenient for the cases have large amount of graphs. This project uses several aesthetic criteria and metrics to evaluate visualization performance which can be a supplement for the course.

## Implementation

### part 1: graphlet kernel

### part 2: interface

Start the interface:

The interface has three buttons:
* Training: It is used to re-training the dataset, it will generate ~10k connected graphs, calculate and save graphlet frequency.
* Test: It is used to test the model with an input graph and show both the estimated layouts and real layouts in three layout methods. When first run the interface, you don't need to train the data cause we've already trained it, so users can just click test to see layouts.
* Clear: It is used to clear the plots.

and two rows of plots:
* Estimated layout:
* Real layout:
