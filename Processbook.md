# ProcessBook

Up to now, we have 4 .py files in this folder.
* graphlet.py: calculate graphlet frequency by random walk
* layout.py: draw the layout
* knn.py: train a nearest neighbour model
* test.py: Show how to use the files above
* interface.py: Show a interface for user interaction

Please refer to interface.py for usage

## Overview and Motivation
* Graph is often used to abstract data. In many research fields, the problem of data analysis can be transformed into graph analysis that focuses on the topological structure of graph. One of the important parts of this project is to measure the topological similarity between graphs, which is exact what we are interested in.
* This project combines visualization and machine learning. It works on predicting visualiztion performance on specific layouts for graph, using machine learning strategy. By doing this project, we may get further inspriation on how to apply machine learning approaches to visualization.
* So far, the ways we have learnt in class to evaluate visualization layouts are more like intuitive senses rather than numerical metrics. However, the latter one can lead to automatic evaluation process withou human inspection, which is very convenient for the cases have large amount of graphs. This project uses several aesthetic criteria and metrics to evaluate visualization performance which can be a supplement for the course.
